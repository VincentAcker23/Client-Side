        <h2>The Costs of Putting and Ad on a Newspaper</h2>
        <h3>Keeping up with Vince</h3>
        <p>As a small business it is hard to build a newspaper article like Wall Street on the New York Times. 
            To be featured on these newspapers is a well over $1300 
            and being a kid from Picayune that money doesn't just unveil itself. 
            Here at Keeping up with Vince, we make your ads brighter, more bold, and powerful. 
        </p>
